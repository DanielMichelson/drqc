INSTALL for dr_qc

dr_qc works with Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x, together with a RAVE installation.
RAVE and its packages is found at git.baltrad.eu. It will be migrated to
Python 3.5+.

You must set the RAVEROOT environment variable. This is the path to the root
of your RAVE installation, e.g. /opt/baltrad . The Makefiles are already 
configured appropriately, and will use the information you used when building 
RAVE.

Build everything at once with a simple 'make', or if you only want the C 
functionality, go to the 'src' directory and issue 'make' there.

Install the built add-on with 'make install'. This will add the command-line 
binary and compiled Python module to your RAVE installation.

Generate the in-line documentation with doxygen, by issuing 'make doc'.
